# My-First-Project-Ever

Hey! Welcome to my git hub page :D ! Well, I coded this little and simple project for fun right after learning HTML as CSS. Once the goal was finied, I had the curosity to keep learning new features. The feeling of wanting to know more gave me the motivation to continue and start learning coding languages like JS and then React.
